1. General Description
======================

The OCSP (OnLine Certificate Status Protocol) is becoming ever more supported
by current clients as it provides an easy way to get a reliable and fast on-
Line verification of the required certificate(s) status.

The provided responder is capable of answering to complex OCSP requests, an
example of a configuration file and a way to start and make request to the
responded can be found into the etc/ directory.

To get a full list of the supported command-line options simply call the
openca-ocspd program with '-' as an argument:

	$ openca-ocspd -


2. INSTALL
==========

Since v2.0.0+ , the OCSPD server requires the LibPKI package to be installed.
You can download the latest package from any of our servers, more information
about the LibPKI software can be found here:

   http://www.openca.org/projects/libpki/

Please Read the Online install documentation on wiki pages for both the LibPKI
and the OCSPD packages at:

   http://wiki.openca.org/wiki/index.php/LibPKI
   http://wiki.openca.org/wiki/index.php/OCSP_Daemon

NOTE: v2.5.1+ requires LibPKI v0.8.2+

3. Provided files
=================

In the $prefix/etc/ocspd directory you'll find some example files for simple
configuration of the responder. All options are, I guess, self-explicative
and very easy to understand.

In particular, since the OCSP server (v2.0.0+) is based on LibPKI, you will
find:

o $prefix/etc/ocspd/pki - the directory where all the configurations for the
  OCSPD token(s) are kept. You can add/configure new tokens in the token.d
  directory. Keep in mind that tokens are identified by name (not file name).

o $prefix/etc/ocspd/ca.d - the directory which carries all the configuration
  files for the supported CAs. Each file carries the information about a
  CA the responder will provide responses for.

o $prefix/etc/ocspd/private - the directory with the private key of the OCSP
  server. You can change this by editing the token configuration in token.d.

o $prefix/etc/ocspd/certs - the directory with the certificates related to the
  OCSP server's tokens. You can change this by editing the token configuration
  in the token.d/ directory.


4. OCSP Responder certificate
=============================

The OCSP Responder must have its own certificate/key pair to be able to build
and sign the responses. To aceive this you can simply generate a PKCS#10 req
and upload it to your CA by using the appropriate command. Remember that the
certificate MUST contain the "OCSPSigning" extension in the extendedKeyUsage
extension: if requested you'll need to define a new extension file on the ca
(conf/openssl/extfiles) for the OCSP certificate profile.

We provide a script which will generate a new keypair and request in the
bin/ directory. Please use the provided script and send the generated request
file to your CA in order to get the OCSP certificate. To do so, use:

   $ cd PREFIX
   $ sudo bin/ocspd-genreq.sh

this will generate the key in the etc/ocspd/private/ directory and the
request in the etc/ocspd/ one. Once the certificate is installed properly
(follow the instructions provided by the script), you can start/stop the
server by using the etc/init.d/ocspd script:

   $ PREFIX/etc/init.d/ocspd start

and

   $ PREFIX/etc/init.d/ocspd stop

You can also activate extra debugging information, by using the start-debug
startup option as follows:

   $ PREFIX/etc/init.d/ocspd start-debug

This will activate a lot of debugging messages that might help you when more
info is required (e.g., an unknown error).

In order to force CRL reloading for the configured CAs, use the following:

   $ PREFIX/etc/init.d/ocspd reload-crl


5. Known Bugs
=============

Since we re-engineered the server, no extensive testing has been perfomed.
Therefore, we encourage you to report any issue or wrong behavior.

Currently the responder has been tested with Mozilla and it has been reported
to work correctly.
